## ðŸ“Š Objective

To evaluate whether changes in marketing strategy (test group) led to better performance compared to the control group using statistical hypothesis testing.


## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

- Test group spent **11.6% more** than control
- Received **33% fewer impressions** and **41% lower reach**
- **Add to Cart** rate dropped by **32.4%** (statistically significant)
- No significant change in **purchases**

## âœ… Conclusion

The test version underperformed across multiple key metrics but also resulted in more spending. Higher spend did not translate into improved results in other metrics. The control campaign is more efficient and should be preferred if higher spending is not the priority.

## ðŸ“¦ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy)
